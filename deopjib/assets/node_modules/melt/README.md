## About

Melt UI is meant to be used as a base for your own styles and components. It offers:

- Uncoupled builders that can be attached to any element/component
- A clean API focused on simplicity and flexibility
- Typescript and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) support out-of-the-box
- Strict adherence to [WAI-ARIA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
- A high emphasis on accessibility, extensibility, quality and consistency

## Basic Usage

```sh
npm i melt
```

Melt UI provides two ways to use components.

### Using Builders

Builders can be called from a Svelte component, or `svelte.js|ts` files.
Uses getters and setters for reactive properties.

```html
<script lang="ts">
	import { Toggle } from "melt/builders";

	let value = $state(false)
	const toggle = new Toggle({
		value: () => value,
		onValueChange: (v) => (value = v),
	});
</script>

<button {...toggle.trigger}>
	{toggle.value ? "On" : "Off"}
</button>
```

### Using Components

The component pattern provides a more traditional Svelte experience. It provides no elements
or styling, and instead provides you with a instance from the builder. The difference lies in being
able to use the `bind:` directive.

```html
<script lang="ts">
	import { Toggle } from "melt/components";

	let value = $state(false)
</script>

<Toggle bind:value>
	{#snippet children(toggle)}
		<button {...toggle.trigger}>
			{toggle.value ? "On" : "Off"}
		</button>
	{/snippet}
</Toggle>
```
